Notepad2 is my favorite text editor, and with the source code available it offers me the ability to work on some ideas. Today i created a cmake file and compiled notepad2 with mingw. The original source code is from [flo's freeware](http://www.flos-freeware.ch/notepad2.html) and the repository can be found @ [github.com/wtrsltnk](https://github.com/wtrsltnk/notepad2).

Important fact if you want to compile this yourself: you should copy the winres.h to the mingw include folder otherwise the resources wont compile. Its not a pretty solution, but I could not figure out a way to get windres.exe look at the local include folder when compiling the .rc file. Anyhow, all resources work and the toolbar gots images!

I guess the next step is to clean up the files i don't need like the sln and the wdkbuild folder.
