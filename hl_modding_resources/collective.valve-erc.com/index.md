#### [How To Make A Mod](collective.valve-erc.com\How To Make A Mod.html)
This is an overview document intended to answer the most basic question, "How do I make a mod?" This isn't to teach how to code, or create 3D models, but rather how to set up a mod so that it will run in Half-Life. Each mod has different components from other mods: some have new weapons, some new maps, some new monsters. There are just a few basic things that all mods must have, and this document is meant to outline what those are. [Read all](collective.valve-erc.com\How To Make A Mod.html)

#### [Creating New Weapons in the 2.2 SDK](collective.valve-erc.com\Creating New Weapons in the 2.2 SDK.md)

There are plenty of tutorials out there on how to create new weapons, but, while we were working on our mod, Tour of Duty, we found that all of the tutorials were missing some steps that you must take, didn't explain how things like weapon accuracy are adjusted, and most importantly, none explained how to get client side prediction working in the 2.2 SDK. Judging by the number of posts I see on the mailing lists, client side events are causing a lot of problems. [Read all](collective.valve-erc.com\Creating New Weapons in the 2.2 SDK.html)
